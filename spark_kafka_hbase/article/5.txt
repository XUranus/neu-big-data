Go was conceived in 2007 to improve programming productivity at Google, in an era of multicore processors, computer networks, and large codebases.[17] The designers wanted to resolve common criticisms of other languages, while retaining many of their useful characteristics:[18]

Static typing and efficiency (like C++ or Java)
Productivity and ease of use (like Python or JavaScript)[19]
High-performance networking and multiprocessing
The designers cited their shared dislike of C++ as a primary motivation for designing a new language.[20][21][22]

Go was publicly announced in November 2009,[23] and version 1.0 was released in March 2012.[24][25] Go is widely used in production at Google[26] and in many other organizations and open-source projects.

In April 2018, the original logo (Gopher mascot) was replaced with a stylized GO slanting right with trailing streamlines. However, the mascot remained the same.[27]

In August 2018, the Go principal contributors published two ″draft designs″ for new language features, Generics and Error Handling, and asked Go users to submit feedback on them.[28][29] Lack of support for generic programming and the verbosity of error handling in Go 1.x had drawn considerable criticism.
